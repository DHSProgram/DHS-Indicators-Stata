# The DHS Program Code Share Project

This project is aimed at providing Stata and SPSS code for all DHS Program indicators listed in the Guide to DHS Statistics. The project began in 2019 and will run for two years. By September 2020, all code in Stata and SPSS will be available for the public. The code will be published on the [DHS Program Github](https://github.com/DHSProgram) site which contains the repositories DHS-Indicators-Stata and DHS-Indicators-SPSS. Users can download the code from these repositories or clone the repository to their own Github site. Users can also suggest changes to the code that will be reviewed by DHS Program staff before acceptance.

The Guide to DHS Statistics contains 17 Chapters. Chapters 2-17 cover the chapters that would be found in a DHS final report assuming all the key modules were included in a survey. These chapters also cover DHS modules for Malaria and HIV Prevalence, as well as those not part of the core questionnaires. Chapter one is an introduction that does not require code.

The Guide defines an indicator, names the pertinent variables, and explains how the indicator is computed. The DHS Program Code Share Project follows the instructions in the guide required to produce the indicators.

## General instructions

This DHS Code Share Project provides the code that can be used to produce these indicators as well as the standard tables found in a DHS Final Report. The code is organized into one folder for each chapter to follow the organization of the Guide to DHS Statistics. Each chapter has a two letter abbreviation as shown in the table below. IndicatorList.xlsx provides a list of all the indicators along with their labels that will be coded in this project.

## Master files

Each folder contains a Master File from which the user can run all the code files (.do or .sps files) that will code the indicators and produce the tables for that chapter. The user would only need to change the paths in the Master File and the file name for the survey of interest. The user should not delete the globals (macros), and only change to the correct path and survey for their project.

Before running any code, it is advisable to read the Master File for a specific chapter and the associated code files for any notes. For some chapters a selection is required to choose the population of interest; for example selecting the age group for child's vaccination indicators in the CH_VAC.do file or for married versus all women in the Family Planning chapter.

The user may also select the indicators they are interested in for the chapter. Therefore, certain code files can be commented out in the Master Files so they do not run, or certain sections within a code file can also be commented out. If certain indicators are commented out, the same indicators in the table code file for the tabulations will also need to be commented out.

## Country-specific changes in indicators

There are some country specific changes that may be required. For instance, what is considered a skilled attendant at delivery or what qualifies as a treatment source for acute respiratory infection (ARI) or fever may differ from survey to survey. The user can check the DHS Final Report of the survey to know the correct changes required (in the footnote for the table of interest) and make the change in the code files. Instructions for these specific changes for an indicator are given in the code files to guide the user on how to make the change.

## Working with older surveys

Additionally, because the indicators that are created using the Code Share Project are based on the Guide to DHS Statistics, they reflect the standard variables that are likely in a recent DHS survey dataset. If the provided code is used to create indicators from older surveys, it is possible the variable names have changed over time or are not available. The user may need to check the dataset in use for the availability of the variables needed for coding and may have to adjust for missing variables or rename variables accordingly. Some of the code files will generate the variables with missing values for old surveys if the survey does not have that variable.

In addition, older surveys (mainly before 2000) do not have a wealth index and the files would need to be merged with a WI file to obtain the wealth index. For anthropometry indicators, surveys before roughly 2006 would need to be merged with a HW file to obtain the WHO haz, waz, and whz indicators.

## Checking for small observations

Tabulations do not check for number of observations. The DHS convention is to suppress estimates that are based on 25 or less unweighted observations and to place in parenthesis around any estimate based on 25-49 observations. It is the user's responsibility to check for the number of unweighted observations before relying on the estimate. The tabulations also do not provide any statistical testing or confidence intervals.
