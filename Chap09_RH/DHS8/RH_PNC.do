Program: 			RH_PNC.do - DHS8 update
Purpose: 			Code PNC indicators for women and newborns
Data inputs: 		IR dataset
Data outputs:		coded variables
Author:				Lindsay Mallick and Shireen Assaf, DHS8 updates by Shireen Assaf
Date last modified: March 4, 2024 by Trevor Croft
Notes:				Fourteen new indicators for DH8, see below. 
		
In DHS8 we use the NR file for computing these indicators. Previously the IR file was used. In addition the variable p19 is used instead of b19.
					
Also in DHS8, the DHS Final reports have three denominators for the Mother's PNC indicators: 1. recent livebirths only (m80==1), 2. recent stillbirths only (m80==3)
3. and recent livebirths + stillbirths. To tabulate the indicators for denominator 1 and 2, run the code below and use m80 to select for the denominator of interest (m80==1 for livebirths or m80=3 for stillbirths). To compute the indicators for denominator 3, tabulate the indicators with the condition (_n == 1 | caseid != caseid[_n-1]) which keeps if birth is last live birth or last still birth (see notes in main file). 

The Newborn PNC indicator are reporting only among the recent livebirths (m80==1)
